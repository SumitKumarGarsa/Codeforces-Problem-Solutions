# Codeforces Problem Solutions

A curated collection of solutions to problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), organized by contest, difficulty, and topic. This repository serves as a personal archive of competitive programming practice and a reference for algorithmic techniques and patterns.

## 📌 Objectives

* Maintain structured solutions to Codeforces problems
* Track progress in competitive programming
* Document approaches and optimizations
* Build a reusable algorithm reference

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Codeforces-Problem-Solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a problem by contest, rating, or topic
3. Compile and run

   ```bash
   g++ file.cpp -O2 -std=c++17 -o solution
   ./solution
   ```

## 📈 Progress Tracking

You can optionally maintain a solved list:

| Problem         | Rating | Topic  | Status |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Example Problem | 1000   | Greedy | ✅      |

## ✍️ Notes

* All solutions are written primarily in **C++**.
* Code prioritizes clarity and efficiency suitable for contests.
* Some problems may include multiple approaches.

## 📚 References

* Codeforces Editorials
* Competitive Programming resources
* Personal contest notes
